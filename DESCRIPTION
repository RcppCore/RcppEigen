Description: R and Eigen integration using Rcpp.
 Eigen is a C++ linear template library for linear algebra: matrices,
 vectors, numerical solvers and related algorithms.  It supports dense
 and sparse matrices on integer, floating point and complex numbers.
 The performance on many algorithms is comparable with some of the
 best implementations based on Lapack and level-3 BLAS.
 .
 The RcppEigen package includes the header files from the Eigen C++
 template library (currently version 3.0.3). Thus users do not need to
 install Eigen itself in order to use RcppEigen.
 .
 Eigen is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3 or later, and also
 under the GNU GPL version 2 or later.  RcppEigen (the Rcpp
 bindings/bridge to Eigen) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or
 later, as is the rest of Rcpp.
