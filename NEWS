1 New features visible to users in RcppEigen-0.3.1.2.3 
=======================================================
  + Fix to RcppEigenCholmod.h to incorporate changes in the
    cholmod_factor struct. These changes are necessary if code
    compiled against RcppEigen that uses CHOLMOD factors is to be run
    with versions of the Matrix package >= 1.1-0

2 New features visible to users in RcppEigen-0.3.1.2 
=====================================================
  + Upgraded to Eigen 3.1.2
  + Fixes to RcppEigenWrap.h and adjustment of tests accordingly.
    The changes allow RowMajor matrices to be wrapped (thanks to Gael
    Guennebaud) but cannot handle RowVector types. There will need to be
    more template metaprogramming done to redirect the case of RowVector,
    which cannot be changed to a ColMajor form.
  + Because of changes in R, -DNDEBUG is automatic. One must override it with
    -UNDEBUG in the local ~/.R/Makevars to activate the debugging code.
  + New (unexported) functions CxxFlags() and RcppEigenCxxFlags() for use in
    Makefiles
  + Fixes related to Rcpp 0.10.*

3 New features visible to users in RcppEigen-0.3.1 
===================================================
  + Upgraded to Eigen 3.1.0
  + Removed the "unsupported" Eigen module AutoDiff which defined a
    macro "sign" that conflicted with a function in the R API (which
    really should be visible as "Rf_sign", not sure why it shows up as
    "sign" and don't have time to investigate)
  + Commented out several tests involving complex vectors and
    matrices.  Again there are compilation problems related to
    conflicting definitions in the std:: namespace and the R API and
    Eigen, which I don't have time to investigate.

4 New features visible to users in RcppEigen-0.2.0 
===================================================
  + Upgraded the version of Eigen to 3.1.0-alpha2, in which the sparse
    matrix modules are now in the "supported" tree.
  + Added several "unsupported" Eigen modules including
    - AutoDiff (a small automatic differentiation package adapted to
      vectors and matrices)
    - IterativeSolvers (iterative linear and nonlinear solver algorithms)
    - KroneckerProduct (as the name implies)
    - MatrixFunctions (matrix cos, exp, log, sin, sinh, etc.)
    - NonlinearOptimization (based on minpack but uses reverse
      communication - yay!)
    - NumericalDiff (numerical differentiation of vector-valued or
      matrix-valued functions)
    - Polynomials (polynomial representation and solution using a QR
      algorithm)
    - Skyline (sparse skyline matrices useful in finite-element codes)
    - SparseExtra (dynamic sparse matrices, now deprecated, and Matrix
      Market I/O functions)
    - Splines (multidimensional spline representations and spline
      interpolation)
  + At present all these modules, including the MatrixFunctions
    module, are included with RcppEigen.h but that may change if too
    many people get unexpected results from A.exp()
  + The ability to wrap RowMajor sparse matrices and to use
    as<Eigen::ArrayXd> etc.

5 New features not visible to users in RcppEigen-0.2.0 
=======================================================
  + Migrated some tests to the testthat package.  Currently there is
    some difficulty with combining testthat, inline and R CMD check.
    These checks are available as


  library(testthat)
  test_package(RcppEigen)
