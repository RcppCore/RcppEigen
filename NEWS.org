* New features visible to users
  + Upgraded the version of Eigen to 3.1.0-alpha2, in which the sparse
    matrix modules are now in the "supported" tree.
  + Added several "unsupported" Eigen modules including
    - AutoDiff (a small automatic differentiation package adapted to
      vectors and matrices)
    - IterativeSolvers (iterative linear and nonlinear solver algorithms)
    - KroneckerProduct (as the name implies)
    - MatrixFunctions (matrix cos, exp, log, sin, sinh, etc.)
    - NonlinearOptimization (based on minpack but uses reverse
      communication - yay!)
    - NumericalDiff (numerical differentiation of vector-valued or
      matrix-valued functions)
    - Polynomials (polynomial representation and solution using a QR
      algorithm)
    - Skyline (sparse skyline matrices useful in finite-element codes)
    - SparseExtra (dynamic sparse matrices, now deprecated, and Matrix
      Market I/O functions)
    - Splines (multidimensional spline representations and spline
      interpolation)
  + At present all these modules, including the MatrixFunctions
    module, are included with RcppEigen.h but that may change if too
    many people get unexpected results from A.exp()
  + The ability to wrap RowMajor sparse matrices and to use
    as<Eigen::ArrayXd> etc.

* New features not visible to users
  + Migrated some tests to the testthat package.  Currently there is
    some difficulty with combining testthat, inline and R CMD check.
    These checks are available as
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
library(testthat)
test_package(RcppEigen)
#+END_EXAMPLE
